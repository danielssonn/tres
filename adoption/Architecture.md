# Enterprise Architecture Layer Model

## Executive Digest

### Overview

This document outlines a foundational enterprise architecture approach built on four distinct layers, each with specific responsibilities and quality attributes. The model emphasizes how architectural decisions flow both upward (requirements) and downward (constraints) through the technology stack.

### The Four-Layer Model

![Enterprise Architecture Layers](enterprise_architecture_layers)

The architecture is structured as a dependency stack where each layer builds upon the capabilities of the layer below while defining constraints for the layer above.

### Layer Breakdown

#### 1. Infrastructure Layer (Foundation)

**Purpose**: Establishes the physical and virtual foundation of the enterprise

- **Core Components**: Compute resources, storage systems, network infrastructure, cloud/on-premises environments
- **Key Quality Attributes**:
  - **Scalability**: Ability to handle growing workloads automatically
  - **Performance**: 99.9% uptime and response time guarantees
  - **Reliability**: Five-nines availability targets
- **Impact**: Determines environmental constraints and non-functional requirements for all upper layers

#### 2. Orchestration Layer (Coordination)

**Purpose**: Enables coordination and communication between system components

- **Core Components**: APIs, workflows, integration patterns, service meshes, message queues
- **Key Quality Attributes**:
  - **Maintainability**: Simplified system management and updates
  - **Observability**: 360-degree visibility into system behavior
  - **Composability**: Ability to combine services into new capabilities
- **Impact**: Transforms isolated infrastructure into coordinated, manageable systems

#### 3. Business Architecture Layer (Capability)

**Purpose**: Translates organizational intent into system behavior

- **Core Components**: Domain models, business rules, capability maps, policy enforcement mechanisms
- **Key Quality Attributes**:
  - **Agility**: Rapid response to changing business requirements
  - **Flexibility**: Dynamic adaptation to new business models
  - **Testability**: Validation of business logic and rules
- **Impact**: Bridges business strategy with technical implementation

#### 4. Common Data Layer (Language)

**Purpose**: Provides semantic coherence across the entire enterprise

- **Core Components**: Taxonomies, ontologies, data models, metadata management, schema registries
- **Key Quality Attributes**:
  - **Consistency**: Uniform data representation across systems
  - **Interoperability**: Seamless data exchange between domains
  - **Usability**: Optimized data access and comprehension
- **Impact**: Ensures organizational alignment through shared vocabulary and data standards

### Critical Success Factors

#### Bidirectional Dependencies

- **Upward Flow**: Business requirements drive technical decisions
- **Downward Flow**: Technical constraints limit architectural possibilities
- **Alignment Imperative**: Misalignment between layers creates technical debt

#### Quality Attribute Propagation

Each layerâ€™s quality attributes directly influence the layers above and below:

- Infrastructure performance limits orchestration throughput
- Orchestration patterns affect business process efficiency
- Business flexibility requirements drive data model design
- Data consistency needs influence infrastructure choices

#### Governance Implications

- **Layer Responsibility**: Clear ownership and accountability for each architectural layer
- **Cross-Layer Coordination**: Mechanisms to ensure decisions consider impact across all layers
- **Evolution Management**: Coordinated approach to architectural changes and upgrades

### Implementation Considerations

#### Assessment Questions

1. **Current State**: How well do our existing systems align with this layered model?
1. **Gap Analysis**: Where are the most significant misalignments between layers?
1. **Priority Areas**: Which layer requires immediate attention to support business objectives?
1. **Integration Points**: How do our current systems map to these architectural boundaries?

#### Strategic Benefits

- **Clarity**: Clear separation of concerns across technical and business domains
- **Scalability**: Modular approach enables targeted improvements
- **Risk Management**: Isolated layer changes reduce system-wide impact
- **Vendor Strategy**: Layer-specific vendor relationships and technology choices

### Next Steps

1. **Current State Mapping**: Inventory existing systems against the four-layer model
1. **Gap Identification**: Assess misalignments and technical debt across layers
1. **Roadmap Development**: Prioritize improvements based on business impact and technical feasibility
1. **Governance Framework**: Establish layer-specific ownership and decision-making processes
