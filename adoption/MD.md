## **3. Executive Interview Framework**

### **A. Technology Vision & Platform Strategy**

**Expected Questions:**
- "How do you envision the future of digital onboarding in banking, and what technology architecture would you build?"
- "What's your approach to balancing innovation speed with regulatory compliance and security?"
- "How do you measure success for a platform that serves multiple business units?"

**Your Strategic Responses:**

**Digital Onboarding Vision:**

> "The future is 'seamless onboarding' — where we use data intelligence and AI to pre-populate applications, reduce friction to near-zero, and deliver instant decisions. I envision a platform that turns onboarding from a barrier into a competitive advantage, using API-first architecture that enables rapid product innovation while maintaining security and compliance."

>"I always start with the definition of 'done'. In onboarding, the definition of done is when a new client funds an account, inititate a loan or setup a liquidity structure. Many things need to happen, from  sanctions screening, tax rewiews, collateral documentation processing to user setup and account open activities. Three major pillars enunderpin this flow - **Entities** with their ability to express client relationships, **Products** with the ability to normalize the taxonomy of products and services offered and finally **Entitlements** - encapsulating the rules applied to both entity representatives (administrators, corporate signers) and Products, ensuring a compliant access to the Products and Services on offer. With these three pillars, we can create novel Product curation experiences for clients, growing the business into new client segments via innovative product offering."



**Innovation & Compliance Balance:**
> "I practice 'compliance by design'—building regulatory requirements and security controls into the platform architecture from day one. This lets us move fast on customer-facing features while maintaining trust. I use DevSecOps methodologies and automated compliance testing to ensure we can innovate without compromising control."


**Platform Success Metrics:**
> "I measure platform success across three dimensions: Customer Experience (completion rates, time-to-activation, satisfaction scores), Business Impact (revenue attribution, cost reduction, market share), and Technical Excellence (availability, performance, scalability). The platform succeeds when business units view it as an accelerator, not a constraint."

### **B. Product Innovation & Customer Experience**

**Expected Questions:**
- "How do you approach omnichannel experience design for complex banking products?"
- "What's your framework for prioritizing technology investments across competing business demands?"
- "How do you integrate customer feedback into platform development cycles?"

**Your Strategic Responses:**

**Omnichannel Design Philosophy:**
>"On OMNI Channel - Digital Onboarding doesn't mean that client does everything in a self-service digital portal. It means that client always has the visibility into the process and next steps, regardless of channel or pane of glass. We call it transparency. It does not matter whether the next steps happen in a self service portal, happens over assisted babk office channel, via ERP integration or are even received as a SWIFT message. This is what OMNI channel is - giving the client a unified view and at the same time not prescribing the mode of interaction. We know our clients run a complex business. We need to make it easy and transparent to do financial business with us."


**Investment Prioritization:**
> "I use a weighted scoring model: Customer Impact (40%), Revenue/Cost Impact (30%), Technical Debt Reduction (20%), and Regulatory/Risk Requirements (10%). But the real success comes from building platforms that enable business units to self-serve many of their needs, reducing the need for constant prioritization battles."

**Customer-Centric Development:**
> "I embed customer experience researchers directly in development teams and use continuous feedback loops—real-time analytics, A/B testing, user interviews, and business stakeholder input. We build feedback mechanisms into the platforms themselves, so we're constantly learning and improving."

### **C. Technology Leadership & Team Building**

**Expected Questions:**
- "How do you build high-performing technology teams in a competitive talent market?"
- "Describe your approach to managing complex, multi-vendor technology implementations"
- "How do you influence business stakeholders when you don't have direct authority over them?"

**Your Strategic Responses:**

**Technology Talent Strategy:**
> "I focus on building 'learning organizations' where people grow their skills continuously. In banking technology, the most scarce talent wants to work on meaningful problems with modern tools. I create environments where engineers can see direct customer impact, work with cutting-edge technology, and develop both technical and business skills."

**Vendor & Implementation Management:**
> "Complex implementations succeed through clear architecture governance and strong partnership management. I establish integration standards early, maintain vendor scorecards on delivery and innovation, and build internal capabilities to reduce vendor dependency over time. The key is treating vendors as extensions of your team, not external resources."

**Matrix Influence & Stakeholder Management:**
> "Influence without authority requires establishing yourself as the 'trusted advisor' who makes business stakeholders successful. I invest time understanding their P&L pressures, speak their language (revenue impact, not technical features), and deliver quick wins that build credibility for larger initiatives. Regular communication and transparency about challenges builds trust."

---

### **Why are you considering leaving RBC, especially given your success with RBC Clear?**
I'm not actively seeking to leave - I was approached about this opportunity because of the RBC Clear success. What's compelling about TD is the chance to apply proven methodologies at an even larger scale while helping TD establish market leadership in digital corporate banking. It's the difference between optimizing existing success versus creating new competitive advantage."

### **What specifically attracts you to TD versus other opportunities?**
Three factors: TD's commitment to transformation evidenced by the $1B business case, the opportunity to lead enterprise-wide change rather than LOB focused initiative, and the cultural alignment with client-centric innovation. TD has the scale and ambition to not just match RBC Clear, but exceed it."

### **How do we know you won't leave TD in 2-3 years for the next opportunity?**
I'm looking for the opportunity to build something transformational that defines my career legacy. Digital corporate banking is at an inflection point, and leading TD's transformation represents the chance to establish new industry standards. I'm interested in long-term value creation, not just career progression.

### **Walk me through the biggest technical challenge you faced with RBC Clear and how you solved it**
The biggest challenge was integrating regulatory compliance requirements with consumer-grade user experience expectations. Fortune 1000 treasury teams wanted seamless workflows, but we couldn't compromise on KYC/AML validation. We solved it by designing compliance as invisible workflow transitions - clients experienced frictionless progression while we maintained enhanced audit trails and regulatory validation."

### **How do you stay current with fintech innovations and digital banking trends?**
I maintain active engagement with industry forums, fintech partnerships, and client advisory councils. But most importantly, I study client behavior data and feedback loops. Innovation should be driven by actual user needs, not just technological possibilities. That client-first approach is what made RBC Clear successful."

### **What's your perspective on AI and machine learning in corporate banking onboarding?**
AI has tremendous potential for pattern recognition in document processing, risk assessment automation, and personalized experience design. However, it must enhance rather than replace human judgment, especially in corporate banking where relationship management remains critical. I see AI as an accelerator for the human-centered design approach we pioneered at RBC Clear.

### **Describe your leadership style and how you build high-performing teams.**
I lead lead from the front. Big believer in empowerment and transparency. I start by ensuring everyone understands how their work connects to client impact and business outcomes. Then I provide clear success metrics while giving teams autonomy in execution. At RBC Clear, this approach resulted in cross-functional teams that self-organized around client experience goals rather than departmental silos."

### **How do you handle resistance to change, especially from senior stakeholders?**
I address resistance through engagement. Requesting a simple consult from a resisting stakeholder is a great way to find the root cause of the resistance. Involvemnt in quick wins then often helps to truly communicate the client impact and business results. Then resistance typically converts to advocacy.

### **Tell me about a time you had to make an unpopular decision. How did you handle it?**
During RBC Clear MVP development, we had to eliminate a popular AI feature that everyone was very excited about - Intelligent Document Processing where we could use AI to analyze client's documents in real time. Unfortunately the technical assessment uncovered Recovery Time Objective (RTO) mismatch that would double overall system recovery timeline. We have decided to launch without it and allow the technology to mature, so the capabilities and risks are more aligned. Fortunately, we see a significant technology improvements these days, which will eventually allow us to introduce this capability early next year.

### **How do you manage expectations with board-level executives and senior leadership?**
I focus on three elements: clear communication of realistic timelines, regular progress updates with specific, data driven metrics. I also focus on the "Do:Say" ratio
be it in a daily standup, senior meeting or hallway conversation. Trust and transparency are absolutely paramount.


### **Tell me about a time when somethng went wrong. How did you handle it?**
Earlier in RBC Clear development, we discovered that a feature (ACH onboarding) we designed and deployed leaves clients confused and makes them abandon the digital solution. It was a bit too complex and over engineered. I took two prong approach - first keep the clients who have already tried whole and complete the setup on their behalf, why communicating the more nuanced aspects of the integration. Second, we have immediately scheduled review and redesign of this capability, which we launched in two weeks. We have kept clients aware of the situation, while quickly deploying a fix. 

### **How do you balance innovation speed with regulatory compliance requirements?**
Designing compliance into innovation from the beginning rather than treating it as a constraint. Every feature we build has compliance control points embedded, by design. We embedded regulatory experts into our design teams for RBC Clear, so compliance became a design parameter rather than a review checkpoint. 

### **What's your approach to managing operational risk in digital transformation?**
Blue/Green deplyments, prudent adoption of Feature Flags and extensive test automation. This approach minimizes business disruption while enabling continuous improvement based on real-world usage.

### **What's your perspective on TD's competitive position in corporate banking?**
TD has strong brand recognition and client relationships, but RBC Clear has established a digital experience advantage that's attracting Fortune 1000 attention. TD's opportunity is to leapfrog rather than catch up - using lessons learned from RBC Clear to build an even superior platform across more segments

### **How would you prioritize features and capabilities for TD's digital transformation?**
Client impact first, business value second, technical feasibility third. I'd start with comprehensive client journey research to identify the highest-pain processes, then prioritize solutions that deliver measurable client experience improvement and clear business ROI. Based on RBC Clear experience, onboarding optimization typically delivers the highest impact across all metrics."

### **What has been your biggest professional failure, and what did you learn from it?**
Early in my career, I focused too heavily on technical solutions without sufficient client impact. I lead CIBC's Technology R&D, which was a lot of fun, but only 1 of 10 projects saw day light. I learnt that introducing change in a large organization is a complex and nuanced process, but it took me too long. But it taught me the value of fail-fast also gave me the appreaciation and perspective to drive significant transformation initiatives like RBC Clear.

### **Where do you see your career in 5-10 years?**
I see myself as a recognized thought leader in digital banking transformation, having established new industry standards for client experience in corporate banking. Ideally, having led TD's transformation to market leadership and continuing to drive innovation that influences the entire industry. I'm interested in building legacy impact, not just career progression."

### **What motivates you professionally?**
Solving complex problems that create measurable impact for both clients and business outcomes. At RBC Clear, seeing Fortune 1000 treasury teams genuinely excited about their banking experience was incredibly rewarding. I'm motivated by the intersection of innovation (disruption), client value, and business success - finding solutions that deliver on all three simultaneously."
