## **6. Interview Responses: Delivery Excellence**

### **Expected Question: "How do you measure program success?"**

**Response:**
> "I use a three-tier metrics approach. Tier 1 is DORA metrics showing engineering excellence—deployment frequency, lead time, change failure rate, and recovery time. Tier 2 is SAFe program metrics showing delivery predictability—PI objectives achievement, velocity consistency, and flow efficiency. Tier 3 is business outcome metrics showing value realization—client satisfaction, operational efficiency, and financial returns."

### **Expected Question: "How do you handle delivery challenges?"**

**Response:**
> "My dashboard shows early warning indicators before problems become critical. For example, if velocity drops >15% or defect rates increase >20%, automated alerts trigger immediate team huddles. I use objective metrics to diagnose root causes—is it capacity, complexity, dependencies, or quality issues? Then apply targeted interventions like resource reallocation, scope adjustment, or process improvement."

### **Expected Question: "What's your approach to stakeholder reporting?"**

**Response:**
> "Different stakeholders need different views of the same data. Executives get one-page health summaries with trend analysis and forecast projections. Operations teams get detailed burnup charts and velocity reports. Business users get outcome metrics showing the client experience improvements they care about. All reports link back to our original success criteria so everyone understands progress toward shared goals."
