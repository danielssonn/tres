I'll redesign the system architecture to focus on assertion-driven, explicit relationship creation through the UI, moving away from automated inference to human-guided relationship establishment.Now let me create a detailed workflow diagram showing the assertion-driven process:Now let me create a component interaction diagram showing the explicit relationship creation process:## **Redesigned System Architecture Summary**

### **Core Philosophy Shift**

**FROM**: Automated relationship inference and discovery
**TO**: Human-guided, assertion-driven, explicit relationship creation

### **Key Architectural Changes**

#### **1. Strict Scope Separation**
- **Within MDMs**: Ownership, customer-vendor, account relationships (managed by each MDM)
- **Cross-MDM Only**: Operational authority, management, service provision relationships
- **No Automatic Creation**: Every cross-MDM relationship requires human operator validation

#### **2. Assertion-Driven Process**
```
Document → Assertions → Human Review → Entity Resolution → Relationship Creation
```
- **Assertions** are extractions, NOT relationships
- **Human operators** validate every entity mapping
- **Explicit creation** of each relationship with full audit trail

#### **3. Human-Centric UI Workflow**

**Step 1: Assertion Review**
- Present extracted text with context
- Show entity mentions and confidence scores
- Allow operator to skip irrelevant assertions

**Step 2: Cross-MDM Entity Resolution**
- Search across all MDM systems simultaneously
- Present candidate entities with match confidence
- Require explicit operator selection for source and target

**Step 3: Relationship Definition**
- Select from cross-MDM relationship types only
- Define authority scope, geographic limits, temporal parameters
- Validate relationship compatibility

**Step 4: Explicit Creation**
- Validate logical consistency and proof backing
- Create relationship with complete audit trail
- Link to supporting proof documents

#### **4. Relationship Types (Cross-MDM Only)**
- `has_trading_authority_for`: Individual (Wealth MDM) → Corporate entity (Commercial MDM)
- `manages`: Service provider → Client entity across systems
- `operates_on_behalf_of`: Agent → Principal across MDMs
- `is_custodian_for`: Custodian → Asset holder across systems
- `provides_services_to`: Service provider → Client across MDMs
- `is_advisor_to`: Advisor → Advisory client across systems

#### **5. Complete Audit Trail**
Every relationship includes:
- **Source assertion** and extraction method
- **Entity resolution decisions** and operator rationale
- **Validation steps** performed
- **Proof document backing**
- **Operator identity** and creation timestamp
- **Change history** with approval workflows

### **Benefits of This Approach**

1. **Regulatory Compliance**: Human validation ensures defensible relationships
2. **Audit Readiness**: Complete decision trail for every relationship
3. **Quality Control**: No automated errors in critical operational relationships
4. **Flexibility**: Operators can handle complex cases that automation cannot
5. **Accountability**: Clear responsibility for each relationship decision
6. **Scalability**: Focus on cross-MDM relationships only (smaller scope)

### **Operational Impact**

- **Operators become** relationship validation specialists, not data processors
- **System provides** intelligent assistance but requires human judgment
- **Audit trail** supports regulatory examinations and compliance reporting
- **Quality** increases through human oversight of critical operational relationships
- **Scope** is manageable by focusing only on cross-MDM operational authorities

This architecture ensures that your proof repository creates **defensible, auditable, and accurate** cross-MDM relationships while leveraging human expertise for the complex entity resolution and relationship validation that automation cannot reliably perform.
